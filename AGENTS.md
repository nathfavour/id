1. don't write documentation unless explicitly told do. no incessant generation of markdown files, summary files, txt, etc. just do one thing and do it well: write the code

2. don't run any build commmands, as those interrupt with my dev commands and make me have to restart my application. don't run until you're told to run and verify if things work. simply write/modify code.

3. don't bother with git. i'll handle it myself. just write the code.
