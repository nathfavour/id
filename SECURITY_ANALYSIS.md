# Security Analysis: Self-Hosted Passkey vs Third-Party Services

## Overall Security Score: **6-7 / 10**
*Third-party services (Passwordless.dev, Auth0, Yubico): 8.5/10*

---

## STRONG AREAS (Equivalent to Third-Party)

### ‚úÖ Core WebAuthn Cryptography (9/10)
- Uses industry-standard `@simplewebauthn/server` library
- Same verification as commercial services
- Proper signature validation & counter replay detection

### ‚úÖ Challenge-Response Security (8/10)
- Stateless HMAC-signed tokens with time binding
- User-bound challenges prevent cross-user attacks
- Timing-safe comparison using `crypto.timingSafeEqual()`

### ‚úÖ Credential Isolation (7/10)
- Each passkey stored per-user in Appwrite
- One leaked credential doesn't expose others

### ‚úÖ Basic Rate Limiting (6/10)
- Per-IP rate limiting on registration/auth
- Prevents basic brute force

## CRITICAL WEAKNESSES

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Secret Key Management (4/10)

**Location**: `lib/passkeys.ts` line 18
```typescript
const secret = process.env.PASSKEY_CHALLENGE_SECRET || 'dev-insecure-secret';
```

**Vulnerabilities**:
- If `PASSKEY_CHALLENGE_SECRET` leaks ‚Üí attacker can forge ANY valid challenge token
- Default fallback is `'dev-insecure-secret'` (publicly known)
- Stored in plain environment variables
- No rotation mechanism
- No key versioning

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker obtains `PASSKEY_CHALLENGE_SECRET` from logs/env dump
2. Attacker generates valid `challengeToken` for `victim@example.com`
3. Attacker creates fake attestation object
4. System accepts it (HMAC validates correctly)
5. **Full account takeover**

**Third-Party Advantage**: Services rotate secrets internally, never exposed to users

**Fix**: Implement automated key rotation every 90 days
**Impact**: +1.0 points

---

### üî¥ HIGH: Distributed Rate Limiting (4/10)

**Location**: `lib/rateLimit.ts`
```typescript
const buckets = new Map<string, Bucket>();  // Lost on server restart!
```

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Rate limiter resets on server restart
- Doesn't work across multiple instances
- Each instance has separate bucket
- Attacker distributes requests across instances

**Attack Path** (multi-instance deployment):
1. Production runs 5 instances of the app
2. Limit is 10 attempts per instance per window
3. Attacker sends 2 requests to each instance
4. Effective limit: 10 √ó 5 = 50 attempts total (should be 10)
5. Brute force becomes feasible

**Third-Party Advantage**: Distributed caches (Redis, Memcached) with persistence

**Fix**: Move to Redis/Memcached
**Impact**: +0.8 points

---

### üî¥ HIGH: Counter Replay Detection (5/10)

**Location**: `lib/passkey-server.ts` line 173
```typescript
counterObj[credentialId] = newCounter;  // Just overwrites, no backwards check
```

**Vulnerabilities**:
- If attacker clones device's passkey ‚Üí both can sign in indefinitely
- No detection if counter goes backwards
- No alert mechanism
- Race conditions on concurrent logins

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker somehow obtains user's passkey private key (device exported/stolen)
2. Attacker signs in ‚Üí counter: 5 ‚Üí 6
3. Legitimate user signs in ‚Üí counter: 6 ‚Üí 7
4. System has no idea one is cloned
5. Both continue to have access indefinitely

**Third-Party Advantage**: Monitors full auth history, detects anomalies

**Fix**: Reject sign-in if counter goes backwards, require account recovery
**Impact**: +0.6 points

---

### üü† HIGH: Server API Key Exposure (5/10)

**Location**: `lib/passkey-server.ts` line 9
```typescript
const serverApiKey = process.env.APPWRITE_API || process.env.APPWRITE_API_KEY || '';
```

**Vulnerabilities**:
- If server is compromised (RCE, log injection) ‚Üí key is exposed
- Key has full Appwrite permissions (not scoped)
- Can modify ANY user account
- Can register passkeys for anyone

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker finds RCE vulnerability elsewhere in app
2. Executes `process.env` to extract `APPWRITE_API`
3. Uses API key to modify all user accounts
4. Registers passkeys for any user
5. Can impersonate anyone

**Third-Party Advantage**: Issues scoped tokens with minimal permissions

**Fix**: Use Appwrite server-side functions with scoped API keys
**Impact**: +0.5 points

---

### üü† MEDIUM: No Attestation Validation (2/10)

**Location**: `app/api/webauthn/register/options/route.ts` line 49
```typescript
attestationType: 'none',
```

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Can't verify device is genuine
- Attacker could use JavaScript-based WebAuthn emulator
- No way to enforce hardware keys
- No rollback protection

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker uses JavaScript-based WebAuthn emulator (e.g., fake WebAuthn)
2. Emulator creates attestation that looks valid
3. System accepts it (can't validate attestation format)
4. Attacker now has software-based "passkey" (easier to steal)

**Third-Party Advantage**: Offer attestation validation and metadata statements

**Fix**: Change `attestationType` from `'none'` to `'direct'` or `'indirect'`
**Impact**: +0.4 points

---

### üü° MEDIUM: Email Verification Not Required (2/10)

**Location**: `lib/passkey-server.ts` line 50 (prepareUser)

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Email squatting: Attacker registers `ceo@company.com` before real CEO
- Attacker adds passkey to spoofed account
- Real CEO later sees "Account already exists"
- Real CEO locked out unless password recovery exists

**Attack Path**:
1. Attacker registers passkey for `executive@company.com`
2. Real executive visits app
3. Real executive sees "Account already exists"
4. Must use account recovery (if available)
5. Attacker has squatted the account

**Note**: Your fix mitigates this by blocking re-registration on existing accounts!
But still vulnerable to initial squatting.

**Third-Party Advantage**: Enforce email verification before passkey activation

**Fix**: Send verification email, require click-through before passkey activation
**Impact**: +0.3 points

---

### üü° MEDIUM: No Device Anomaly Detection (1/10)

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Passkey used from different country instantly ‚Üí no alert
- Multiple simultaneous sign-ins ‚Üí not flagged
- Sign-in from VPN/Tor ‚Üí not detected
- Compromised key used weeks later ‚Üí no forensic trail

**Third-Party Advantage**: Implement geolocation checks, device reputation, anomaly scoring

**Fix**: Implement GeoIP checks, device fingerprinting
**Impact**: +0.4 points

---

### üü° MEDIUM: No Revocation/Session Management (3/10)

**Vulnerabilities**:
- If device is stolen ‚Üí user can't revoke the passkey
- User must use account recovery
- Can't see "active sessions" using this passkey
- No "sign out all devices" option

**Attack Path**:
1. User's phone with Face ID passkey is stolen
2. User tries to sign in to app to revoke it
3. Can't ‚Üí they're locked out (attacker has the passkey)
4. Must go through password recovery
5. Thief can keep trying indefinitely

**Third-Party Advantage**: Provide session management UI, remote revocation

**Fix**: Add revocation endpoint + user dashboard
**Impact**: +0.5 points

---

### üü° LOW: No Audit Logging (1/10)

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Can't audit who registered when
- Can't detect unusual patterns
- No incident response capability
- Compliance failures (SOC2, HIPAA)

**Third-Party Advantage**: Provide audit logs, compliance dashboards

**Fix**: Log all passkey events to Elasticsearch or CloudWatch
**Impact**: +0.5 points

## RECOMMENDATION BY USE CASE

### ‚úÖ USE SELF-HOSTED IF:
- Single-instance, single-region deployment
- You need complete audit trail & control
- Running internal/enterprise system
- You're willing to implement Priority 1 fixes
- You understand the security tradeoffs
- You have ops resources for maintenance

### ‚úÖ USE THIRD-PARTY IF:
- Multi-region or distributed deployment
- Handling sensitive data (medical, financial)
- Need SOC2/HIPAA compliance
- Don't have ops resources
- Want someone else responsible for security

### üî¥ DO NOT USE SELF-HOSTED WITHOUT FIXES:
- Financial/payment systems
- Healthcare/medical records
- Critical infrastructure
- Systems that must survive breaches
- Without implementing Priority 1 fixes

---

## SUMMARY

Your self-hosted system is **6-7/10 secure** right now. It's suitable for:
- **Low-risk applications** (personal projects, non-critical systems)
- **Single-instance deployments**
- **Systems where you need full control**

If you implement Priority 1 fixes (secret rotation, Redis, sealed vault), it becomes **8.8/10** and suitable for most production use cases.

The gap vs third-party services is primarily **operational** (secrets management, monitoring, incident response) not **cryptographic** (the core WebAuthn is equally secure).
